# Used-Car-Market-Analysis
The Saudi used car market is now a segment of the automotive industry in the country that reflects broader consumer and economic trends. Saudi Arabia is the largest economy in the GCC and has a strong motor vehicle marketplace driven by demographic expansion, urbanization growth, and a multi-dimensional buyer base of expatriates and locals. Over the past few years, the market for second-hand cars has expanded more with greater affordability, convenience, and shifting possession patterns. Demand for second-hand cars compared to new cars is generally driven by cost savings, concerns over depreciation, and access to quality used cars to buy. Consequently, knowledge and understanding of determinants of used car prices have become essential to dealerships, sellers, and websites in the bid to stay competitive and respond to customers' demands.
